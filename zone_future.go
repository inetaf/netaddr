package netaddr

It is December, 2020. The Go 1.16 craze is about to sweep the world.

We are not sure this package will continue to function in the future,
due to the unsafe roguery contained in zone.go.

If you are seeing a compiler error from this file,
from this not-a-comment comment,
it is because we have not checked that this package is still safe to use.
